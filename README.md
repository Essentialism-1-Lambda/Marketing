ESSENTIALISM

This project started at a group project at Lambda school. I worked with a team of six, plus myself. I was responsible for the marketing page and the about me. I used static HTML and CSS with just a hint of JS for the slideshow. I went back after Lambda to give this page a makeover using all the new CSS I had learned since then. I also had to adjust the responsiveness and make my HTML more semantic.


The other team members were supposed to be designing the rest of the site but they hit some snags and because of that the sign up/login buttons are broken.


PROGRAMS USED: 
    HTML
    CSS
    JS

ROLE:
    UI (marketing page and about-us)


I started by going to picsum and finding a picture that I found simple and relaxing.

The theme of the project was "essentialism", the art of giving your time and attention to the things that are essential to your values and and that enhance your life. Because of this we decided on a minimalist design. 

I decided to build a marketing page that used a lot of white space. I chose a light beige background with a grayish font color to appear more muted.  I chose a slideshow as a way of conveying the needed information because I didn't want to clutter up the page with a lot of text at once.
