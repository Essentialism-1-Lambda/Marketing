ESSENTIALISM

This project started at a group project at Lambda school. I worked with a team of six, plus myself. I was responsible for the marketing page. I used static HTML and CSS with just a hint of JS for the modals. I went back after Lambda to give this page a makeover using all the new CSS I had learned since then. I also had to adjust the responsiveness,add animations and make my HTML more semantic.


The other team members were supposed to be designing the rest of the site but they hit some snags and because of that the sign up/login buttons are broken.


PROGRAMS USED: 
    HTML
    CSS
    JS

ROLE:
    UI (marketing page)


 The original theme that my team picked was minimalism, My first draft of the site modeled that idea with a lot of white space and calming colors. After I left the school, I decided to go back and start all over with my own designs. I wanted something fun and bright. I love explosive colors so I thought a dark and pastel theme would be a good project to stretch my designing muscles.
 
 I used a delay animation on the title screen along with a geometric shape to make it pop. The shape was dropped in the media queries.

 Upon going to the home screen, a big header with a pastel pink and blue geometric photo take up the screen. Click the arrow to go to the main content waiting just below eye shot. I achieved this my linking the id of the cards to the anchor tag (arrow). The boxes on the home screen are the same shape as the title page, when you click on them a modal opens up. I made the modal background black, just a shade darker than the regular background color, just to make it stand out.

 The about page is pretty simplistic, boxes of text and photos.

 The login and sign up buttons are non functional. There was no backend work in this marketing page.
