            <h3>What is Essentialism</h3><br>
            <p>  The Way of the Essentialist involves doing less, but better, so you can make the highest possible contribution. It’s not about getting more done in less time or getting less done. It’s about getting only the right things done. It’s about regaining control of our own choices about where to spend our time and energy instead of giving others implicit permission to choose for us. The first step to essentialism is identifying your values</p>

              <p>Our site is designed to help you pinpoint the things in life  that you personally need to feel the most fulfilled and happy. Once you have checked off your desired values, our site will help you make sure your time and goals align with said values.</p>

              <h3>What is expected from you?</h3><br>
              <p>It's very easy. You'll be shown a list of values and be asked to pick the five that are most important to you. These are values such as family, finance, health/fitness..etc etc. Take your time, read through the options carefully and think about why each one is important to you and why it deserves your precious time. There are no wrong answers here.</p><br>
              <p>When you have a good idea about the kind of things that are essential in your life, you'll know what you need to devote time to. Look at how you’re spending your days, your work/life balance, the hobbies and projects you keep busy with. Do these things align with your values? Use this app to make to-do lists and schedule your activities. When you add them, color code them to show which value they align with? if none then take a moment to reflect on why it needs to be finished and if it's worth the time and emotional energy that would be put into it. The point is to weed out the extras in your life that are taking away from the things that actually matter!</p>
